The story tells 4 key moments in John's trip: the first interactions with Axel for basic insurance questions and early user adoption, the car rental website policies, a terrible accident happening outside of the European territory and after the accident recovery. <br /> Each moment represents a feature or a capability: <ul><br /><li> <strong>Step 1</strong>: It shows the first interactions with Axel after downloading the app and how to use it. John asks questions through speech-to-text and gets reliable and precise answers, he also gets the whole conversation transcript in his mailbox. </li> <br /> <li> <strong>Step 2</strong>: John needs to rent a car, but is unsure of the coverage of its own policy and asks Axel if he needs to get the website insurance, getting a comparison of his own contract and the one provided. After finding Axel very useful, he uploads his other contracts, such as Health and Home insurance. Now Axel can advise in other fields and with other contracts. </li> <br /> <li> <strong>Step 3</strong>: John causes a terrible accident while skiing and has broken someone's ski material. He is injured and has to be taken to the nearest hospital in Switzerland, being a private healthcare system. After providing Axel with this information, John can ask for refund from his public healthcare system and other services thanks to his insurance policy Snow and Mountain, covering every ski accident worldwide. </li> <br /> <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: John is victim of a theft while he was shopping. His car has broken glass and he lost his new pair of ski. Axel provided the nearest repair center and the actionnables to get the stolen objects refunded.</li></ul></body>",
